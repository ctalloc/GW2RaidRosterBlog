# Guild Wars 2 Raid Roster

This website is meant to be used by the members of a Guild Wars 2 raid roster I am a part of. Its function is to let the members access easily to the info on the possible builds they can play on their characters for each Raid Boss. It was created to replicate a blog we use for this same purpose adding some fancy features that would bring some quality of life to its users and a more aesthetic experience.

## How to use it

Section "Home" contains a table where you can redirect to the specific section of "Comps & Builds" corresponding to the boss you want the check the comps and builds of.

Each Boss section contains a table where the composition of the team is indicated with the class icons on the left side, and a list of the available builds for those classes on the right side. 

The composition is organised by rows corresponding to each of the subgroups of the team. These subgroups are created for a proper distribution of the boons and buffs.

Clicking on the name of any of the builds listed on the right side of the table will open a new tab with a Build Editor containing all the information you need on that build: equipment, traits, etc.
